=== ABOUT ===
I have built a webscraping code using beautifulsoup to make buying custom PC parts easier in Pakistan.
There are numerous websites for custom parts and it becomes too difficult to search for the best price.
Hence, based on your search input, I search reputable websites and output the name and prices to an excel file ordered from low to high prices.
It becomes much easier to compare the prices of two different online stores when it is automatically tabulated for you.


=== WEBSITES SEARCHED ===
IndusTech
EaseTec


=== HOW TO RUN ===
Download all the files
Open your terminal and enter the following command: python main.py Your Search
An excel workbook will be created containing sheets of your result in the same directory as the download

EXAMPLE:
Command: python main.py Gtx 1660 Super
Open file: Gtx_1660_Super.xlsx


=== FUTURE UPDATES ===
Another sheet with a list of all the products from all the sites ordered from low to high prices
More websites such as Czone and PakDukaan
